		<h1>WHO IS POLYCIUM?</h1><br>

		<div class="hs-poly">
		<p><span><b>Polycium University</b></span> was officially established in March 2024 in the province of Cavite, Philippines, with a vision of becoming a transformative force in Philippine education. As a public educational institution, it was created in response to the growing demand for accessible, high-quality learning opportunities for the youth. Starting with a single campus in Cavite, the university quickly gained recognition for its inclusive approach to education, academic excellence, and its commitment to community development. The founding of Polycium University was driven by a powerful idea: that the best legacy anyone can offer the Filipino people and humanity as a whole is the gift of education. It is through education that people are empowered, communities are uplifted, and nations are strengthened. With this guiding philosophy, Polycium University has dedicated itself to making education a right, not a privilege. Since its inception, the university has steadily expanded beyond Cavite, with the goal of bringing its brand of accessible, values-driven education to more regions across the country. Plans are already underway to establish campuses in key locations, ensuring that students in underserved and geographically remote areas have equal access to the same quality of education as those in urban centers.
		<br><br>
		Polycium University’s aims to develop the potential of young Filipinos to the fullest extent possible. It seeks to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and values needed to become not just professionals, but responsible citizens and leaders in both the national and global arena. By providing a learning environment rich in opportunity, challenge, and support, the university aims to mold individuals who are prepared to meet the challenges of the future with integrity, innovation, and a heart for service.<br>
		Through its growing network of campuses, dedicated faculty, and a curriculum rooted in both excellence and inclusivity, Polycium University continues to pave the way for a brighter future one student, one community at a time.</p>

				<h1>LOGO</h1>
				<br>
				<p>At the heart of the design is a striking flower, symbolizing the core values and aspirations of Polycium University. This central bloom is surrounded by the jade vine, a leguminous vine endemic to the Philippines. Renowned for its cascading clusters of vibrant turquoise or greenish-blue, claw-shaped flowers, the jade vine is not only an ornamental plant but also a symbol of natural beauty, resilience, and uniqueness qualities that the university aims to instill in its students.	
				<br>
				The flower in the center is distinguished by its golden yellow anther, representing the bright futures of the next generation of learners. This golden detail signifies enlightenment, hope, and the transformative power of education. It reflects the university's mission to produce well-prepared, adaptable individuals who are not only equipped to thrive in their chosen fields but also capable of creating meaningful change in their communities and the world.
				<br>
				Together, the central flower and the encircling jade vine embody the harmony between growth and tradition, nature and knowledge, potential and purpose. They serve as a visual representation of the university’s commitment to nurturing students who will bloom into leaders, innovators, and changemakers.</p>
